Diplomacy is a turn based game, devised by a Harvard student in the middle of the 20th century. 7 players communicate,
plan, strategize, deploy their army and fleet, control territories and conquer supply centers. When a player exerts
authority over more than half of the 34 supply centers, the game is considered over -- the said player being the
victor.
